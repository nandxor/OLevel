The following pseudocodes are due by tomorrow, Friday 27th Aug. '21

1.  Make an algorithm using pseudocode that will display your name on screen.

2.  Make an algorithm using pseudocode which will get the name of user and then display it on screen.

3.  Make an algorithm using pseudocode which will get the name of user and greet him as Hello and then his user name.
    For example, if the user enters Azhar, your code should display Hello, Azhar.

4.  Make an algorithm using pseudocode which will get two names from user and greet both of them seperately.
    For example, if the user enters Nawaz and Asif, your code should display Hello, Nawaz on one line and Hello, Asif on second line.

5.  Make an algorithm using pseudocode that will display th sum of 4 and 5.

6.  Make an algorithm using pseudocode which will get a number from user and display it on screen.

7.  Make an algorithm using pseudocode which will get two numbers and display the product of those two numbers.
    For example, if the user enters 5 and 6, your code should display 30.

8.  Make an algorithm using pseudocode which will get a number and display "Greater" if the number entered is more than 50, and "Lesser" if the number is less than 50.

9.  Make an algorithm using pseudocode which will calculate and display the area of circle, by getting the value of radius from user
    Hint : Area of circle = Ï€r*r

The following pseudocodes are due by Tuesday next week, 31st Aug. '21


1.  Make an algorithm using pseudocode which will implement a simple calculator, that will take two numeric values and an arithmetic operator (+,-,*,/) from user and
    perform the choosen calculation. Implement with if and case statements.

2. Make an algorithm using pseudocode, which will get the year of birth and current year from user and display the age in number of months and number of days.

3. Write an algorithm using pseudocode that inputs student's marks for three subjects and shows the grade by checking where the average falls according to this formula:
    A* = 90 - 100
    A = 80 - 89
    B = 70 - 79
    C = 60 - 69
    D = 50 - 59
    E = 40 - 49
    U below 40

4.  Write an algorithm using pseudocode that inputs the grade and display the marks which are required to score that grade according to this formula:
    90 - 100    = A*
    80 - 89     = A
    70 - 79     = B
    60 - 69     = C  
    50 - 59     = D
    40 - 49     = E
    below 40    = F

5.  N students take K apples and distribute them among each other evenly. The remaining (the indivisible) part remains in the basket. How many apples will each
    single student get? How many apples will remain in the basket?
    The program reads the numbers N and K. It should print the two answers for the questions above.

    Example input
    6
    50

    Example output
    8
    2

    For above example, 50 apples were distributed among 6 students, each got 8 apples and 2 remained in basket.

6.  Given the integer N - the number of seconds that is passed since midnight - how many full hours and full minutes are passed since midnight?
    The program should print two numbers: the number of hours (between 0 and 23) and the number of minutes (between 0 and 1339).

    For example, if N = 3900, then 3900 seconds have passed since midnight - i.e. now it's 1:05am. So the program should print 1 and 65 - i.e. 1 full hour and 65 full minutes has passed since midnight. 

    Example input
    3900

    Example output
    1 65

7.  Given two timestamps of the same day: a number of hours, minutes and seconds for both of the timestamps. The moment of the first timestamp happened before the
    moment of the second one. Calculate how many seconds passed between them.

    Example input #1
    1
    1
    1
    2
    2
    2

    Example output #1
    3661

    Example input #2
    1
    2
    30
    1
    3
    20

    Example output #2
    50
